# MTGDB
I'm currently working on a MTG database to store my collection of Magic cards. It will utilize Java on the back end to call an external API (Scryfall) which will be used to pull card information into my PostgreSQL database.  The front end will be created with Vue.js to search, create, and edit collections and decks.
